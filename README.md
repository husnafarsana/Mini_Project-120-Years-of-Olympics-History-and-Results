# Mini_Project-120-Years-of-Olympics-History-and-Results
This project is based on the dataset 120 Years of Olympic History and Athlete Results and is designed to explore how the Olympic Games have evolved. Using Excel and Power Query for initial data cleaning, I handled missing values, removed duplicates, standardized column formats, and prepared the dataset for analysis. After preprocessing, the data was imported into Power BI, where I created an interactive dashboard to visualize key trends and insights. The purpose of this project is to highlight participation, performance, and historical changes across more than a century of Olympic events. The dashboard allows users to explore athlete participation trends, showing how the number of athletes has grown steadily over the years, and provides insights into gender representation, illustrating the significant rise of female participation in modern times. It also includes year-level performance analysis, performance in summer season. Medal distribution across gold, silver, and bronze is presented in an easy-to-understand format, while additional analysis sheds light on the popularity and growth of various sports and events over the years. Advanced DAX measures were applied to calculate total medals, performance_tiers and Age_group and display KPIs such as games per year. Line charts, bar charts, and maps were used to showcase trends visually, while slicers and filters allow users to drill down into specific sports, years, or countries. The outcome of the project is a powerful and interactive tool that provides not only a historical perspective of the Olympics but also an analytical view of performance and inclusivity over 120 years. It tells the story of the Olympics as both a sporting and social movement, capturing how participation expanded globally and how representation evolved with time. This project reflects strong skills in data cleaning, modeling, visualization, and storytelling with Power BI, making it an excellent portfolio example for showcasing data analysis expertise.
